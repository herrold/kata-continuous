# Continuous Integration/Deployment Kata
Build a simple application with reasonable unit and/or integration tests. You can use an existing application if it has tests that will be run by the Continuous Integration solution. There aren't any constraints here, but the application should do something that can be observed by a human.

Configure a Continuous Integration solution to monitor a Version Control System and execute the unit and/or integration tests when new commits are made, as well as building the application.

Provide us with access to your repository and identify a few issues that represent the next features to be delivered in your application. Don't be surprised if someone commits a change that addresses one of the issues. Your project should be complete as delivered, but every project has a 'next step' and we'd like to know what you think your next steps are.

If you wish, configure a Continuous Deployment solution that automatically deploys the application when CI is successful and notifies the Software Engineer when CI fails.

### Components of this exercise:
* A Github or Bitbucket repository with your solution.
  - Make incremental commits so that the reviewer can follow your development process.
* A README file with instructions on how to setup your solution on the reviewâ€™s computer.
  - At the end of the README provide your view of the next steps for this solution.
